#This Week:
Much of our work this (and next) week is collecting data for all of the buildings on campus, primarily from the Wheaton Archives website (http://www.wheatoncollege.edu/archives). 
Aside from that, we created a few new templates in ./html_templates to add variety to the project, and are working on inputing all of our research into xml files to be read by the python file, ./notify/handler.py.


#Next Week:
- By next Tuesday, we should be done with data collection, and each significant spot on campus will have its own .xml file in ./XML/.
