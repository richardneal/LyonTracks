#Project Name:  Lyon Tracks

##Week of: Week 3 - Sept 9, 2013
##Submitted by: Evan Chessman

#Brief Summary:

The goal of the project is to have notifications pushed to the Google Glass when the user is in close proximity to a building on campus. These notifications will display information about the building. 


#This week:
-(a)	This week we obtained the longitude and latitude of the four points that we will use to create a virtual box around the buildings. When the user enters this virtual box a notification will be pushed to the Google Glass. 


-(b)	The one outstanding issue that we have currently is that we haven’t found a way to update the user’s location sooner than every 10 minutes. This is a “Bug” that Google is working out. 




#Next week plans:
The group has not decided what to work on next.
