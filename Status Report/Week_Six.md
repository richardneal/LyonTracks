#Project Name:  Lyon Tracks

##Week of: Week 6 - Oct 8, 2013
##Submitted by: Evan Chessman

#This week:
-(a)	This week a webpage for our project was created. This is now our app engine. 

-(b)	All of the XML files were reviewed for errors.

-(c)	We formally talked to the Campus Direct group. We have a few collaboration ideas.

-(d)	We went over the check list to get our app onto the app store. Due to this we are in the process of coming up with a logo.

-(e)	Went over system architecture. A good link is http://blog.glassdiary.com/post/55154263362/the-standard-architecture-for-mirror-api-glassware This is a good link to help understand 		the system.

-(f)	Images of various buildings were added, however these still need to be incorporated into the XML files themselves.  	




#Next week plans:
This week we are going to add a "Behind the scenes" link on the LyonTracks webpage. This link will have screenshots of the code, diagrams about the system architecture, and in general how the app works. We are getting some code from the Campus Direct group. The Code will save us some time now and when and if we bring our projects together. There is some building information that has yet to be gathered FINISH THAT THIS WEEK. One group member is looking into building recognition (if this is something that is possible).
