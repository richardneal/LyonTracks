#This Week:
This week we concentrated on getting a formatted card to popup when we were in a building.


#How we did it:
In notify/handler.py, we created a Building class and a Card class, where a Building has an array of cards. 

All information on each building is stored in information.xml.

The folder html_templates contains the html formatting for a couple of different card types.


#Unresolved: 
A fair amount of what was done this week has not yet been tested.

Since the google app engine does not host the actual files, we may need to find a work around to pull information from the templates and xml.


#Next Week:
- Continue gathering information about buildings
- Create bounded areas for important outdoor spots on campus (eg Dimple)


#By end of month:
- Have information for each building formatted and inserted into the xml file
